In this project, I worked with an E-Commerce dataset containing transactional data for a UK-based online retail company over two years. The primary customers are wholesale traders.
Tasks include; Data preprocessing & condition checking and Exploratory data analysis to gain insights into customer and transaction conditions.
This project showcased my ability to preprocess data, perform exploratory data analysis, and derive actionable insights from large datasets.
